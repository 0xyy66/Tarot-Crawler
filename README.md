*Disclaimer: web crawling and web scraping are not illegal, but it's an invasive practice, site's owners may not like it.*

I code crawlers and scrapers for fun. Tarot Crawler creates a json file by scraping [Biddy Tarots](https://biddytarots.com).

The json file contains the entire tarot deck with card description, upright and reversed card meanings.

## Usage

Install dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run

```
python3 tarot_crawler.py
```
